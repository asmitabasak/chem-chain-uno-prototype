# 🧪 ChemChain UNO

**"The world's first strategy game where Chemistry is your Superpower."**

ChemChain UNO is a multiplayer card game that blends the addictive mechanics of UNO with real-world chemical reaction logic. Designed for students, gamers, and science enthusiasts, it replaces "numbers and colors" with "elements and reactions."

## 🚀 The One-Line Idea
A multiplayer chemistry card game where players win by forming valid chemical reactions, not by gambling or memorizing facts.

## 🎯 What the App Is
ChemChain UNO is a **Strategy + Learning** hybrid:
* **The Deck:** Every card is a chemical element (Metals, Non-metals, Halogens, Noble Gases).
* **The Goal:** Be the first to empty your hand by reacting with the active center card.
* **The Logic:** If no reaction is possible, match by Group (Family) or Period—just like matching colors in UNO.

## 🧠 Core Gameplay Mechanics
1. **The Reaction Link (Power Move):** Play $Na$ on $Cl$ to form a bond. This triggers a visual animation and forces opponents to draw cards.
2. **The Power Clash:** When two players try to react, the **Reactivity Series** decides the winner (e.g., $F$ beats $Cu$).
3. **The Noble Gas Shield:** Play $Ar$ or $Ne$ to block all incoming reactions and reset the turn.
4. **Special Cards:** Includes Catalysts (Wilds), Inhibitors (Skip), and Equilibrium (Reverse).

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Hackathon Prototype)
* **Frontend:** Single-page HTML5 / Tailwind CSS (CDN) / Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Logic:** Custom "Reaction Engine"
